Background
At DANS, one of our services is NARCIS (National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System), the national portal for information on scientific research in the Netherlands. You can find it at narcis.nl, but a lot more information can be extracted when aggregating information.

These scripts harvest the information in NARCIS via the OAI-PMH interface, and look into this data, mostly functions I've developed at my work.

It's not really built with portability in mind, and I can't share all my data, but I can share some of it.

This branch is trimmed down: Focus is on harvesting Dublin-Core metadata, and producing plots for the NARCIS-website.
Documentation on how to harvest can be found in the Docs-folder
-Reharvest en updaten websitegrafieken algemene opzet.docx is a general overview in Dutch,
-Reharvest instructions.docx contains is a more specific walkthrough
-Harvest Errorfile.docx is for reference in case irregularities are encountered
-Documentatie R-scripts is still work in progress, it contains more information on different scripts.
