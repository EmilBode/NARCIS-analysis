Plotnr;Omschr;header;Tekst7;Access per type;Open access for different scholarly publication types ;This graph shows the percentage of open access publications for a selection of different publication types available in NARCIS. It is evident that open access differs for the different publication types. Whereas only 27.5% of articles (which form 57.3% of the publications in NARCIS) are open access, almost all PhD dissertations are openly accessible (90%). While the open access average of other types of publications is 47.2%, there are large differences between the subcategories, ranging from 13.9% for (legal) annotations to 99.9% for preprints. 2;open Access for theses;Open access of PhD dissertations;"The second figure shows the number of PhD dissertations, both according to NARCIS, and according to the VSNU data. It can be seen that the numbers in NARCIS align with the numbers reported by the VSNU, suggesting that NARCIS is complete in its coverage.For some years, the number of dissertations in NARCIS even exceeds the number reported by the VSNU. One possible explanation for this is the presence of duplicates in NARCIS. Alternatively, there may be omissions in the VSNU data as universities have to provide their data to the VSNU at a set date in time where later corrections are not possible. Additional research will be needed to assess this further."12;open access voor artikelen;Open access of articles ;"In this figure, the amount of open and closed access articles is shown. As NARCIS handles different categories of scholarly publications compared to the VSNU, it is not possible to directly compare the information on articles from NARCIS with the available VSNU data. It is therefore difficult to estimate the true number of articles and thus the completeness of NARCIS. To provide an estimate of the completeness, we compared the number of articles in NARCIS with both the total amount of research output (according to the VSNU), and an estimation of the number of articles based on the VSNU data.It can be seen that the number of articles in NARCIS is growing faster than both of the totals, which suggests NARCIS is getting closer to complete coverage. Importantly, this figure also suggests that the proportion of open access articles is growing over the past years."14;Open Access totalen als percentage VSNU met schatting;Open access of articles across Dutch universities ;"In the last figure, the ratio between the number of open access articles and the estimate of the total number of articles (based on the VSNU data) is shown for the different Dutch universities.Although this figure reflects an estimation rather than the true ratio of open access articles per university, it can give an impression of the individual differences between Dutch universities. While for some universities the number of open access articles in NARCIS is increasing relatively rapidly, other universities show a slower (or no) increase.There are several potential explanations for the observed differences between universities. On the one hand, differences may reflect true deviations in the number of open access articles between universities. On the other hand, differences are also caused by deviations in the completeness of the information that the different universities (can) provide to NARCIS."99;Algemene slottekst;No header given;NARCIS (National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System, narcis.nl) is the national portal for information on Dutch science. Among other things, it aims to give a comprehensive overview of all publications by Dutch scientists, with the help of all the data repository managers in the Netherlands.
